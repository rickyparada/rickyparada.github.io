**Quantum I/O Modeling** at [Mabuchi Lab](https://mabuchilab.org/) $$\vert$$ Distributed Computing $$\vert$$ Hybrid Quantum Systems

Hello there!

My name is Ricky Parada and I'm a Master's student at Stanford University.
As an undergrad, I studied Engineering Physics with a specialization in Quantum Science and Engineering. I'm currently working in the [Mabuchi Lab](https://mabuchilab.org/) on quantum state propogation modeling in open systems using SLH. I'll be graduating in Spring 2024 with an MS in Computer Science (theory specialization).

My current research interests lie in the experimental design of hybrid quantum systems with distributed computing and quantum networking applications.
Last summer, I worked on quantum transduction research in the [Painter Lab](https://painterlab.caltech.edu/) through Caltech SURF, designing a qubit module for high fidelity state transfer from quantum transducers.
I've previously applied Machine Learning and optics in [Herrera Lab](https://fherreralab.com/) as part of study abroad experience in Santiago, investigated cuprate superconductors in [Shen Laboratory](https://arpes.stanford.edu/), and Machine Learning at Autonomous UAV company [Beyond Vision](https://beyond-vision.pt/) in Portugal.
Check out my publications page for more information.

I am from Los Angeles, California and in my free time I enjoy playing soccer, solving Rubik's cubes, and long distance running. Leave a message on my contact page to let me know you were here!
