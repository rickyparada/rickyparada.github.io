# Ricky Parada

Hello there!

My name is Ricky Parada and I'm a Master's student at Stanford University.
As an undergrad, I studied Engineering Physics with a specialization in Quantum Science and Information.
I'll be graduating in Spring 2024 with an MS in Computer Science (theory specialization).

My current research interests lie in the design of hybrid quantum systems with distributed computing and quantum networking applications.
Last summer, I worked on quantum transduction research in Oskar Painter's group at Caltech, designing a qubit module for high fidelity state transfer from quantum transducers.
I've previously researched quantum optics in Herrera Lab at la Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), cuprate superconductors in Shen Lab at Stanford, and Machine Learning at Beyond Vision in Portugal.
Check out my publications page for more information.

I am from Los Angeles, California and in my free time I enjoy playing soccer, solving Rubik's cubes, and long distance running. Leave a message on my contact page to let me know you were here!
