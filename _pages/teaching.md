### **Course Assistant: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

**CS 161 Course Assistant, *Stanford University* (Spring 2023, Fall 2023)**

Prepare/teach weekly sections on algorithm design, prepare problem sets/exams, hold office hours, monitor Q&A forum, grade problem sets/exams

600+ students (Spring 2023)

I've worked with Embedded Ethics fellow Dan Webber to revamp the ethics content, helping him compose lecture materials, rewrite section materials, and grade problem set/quiz questions that engage with ethics content. Teaching an ethics-centered section was one of my fondest memories as a CA, since it wasn't too often that I hear (let alone guide) CS students engaging in topical, thought provoking discussions surrounding the ethical decisions of real tech companies as they related to algorithm design.
