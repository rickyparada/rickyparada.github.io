### **State Propogation Modeling**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing software to characterize state propogations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a variety of optical systems that reside in the nonlinear regime. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems, these results could inform the noise levels displayed by such devices.

### **Qubit Module Design**

**Prof. Oskar Painter, *California Institute of Technology* (June 2023 - September 2023)**

Converged on qubit module parameters that optimize the transfer fidelity of a flying photon emitted by an optomechanical transducer. Performed detailed error analyses to mitigate the effeciency drop due to multiple loss channels. I further prototyped several physical layouts with distinct qubit geometries in Sonnet to determine which configurations were physically realizable.
