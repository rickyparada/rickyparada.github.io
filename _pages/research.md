### **State Propogation Modeling**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing software to characterize state propogations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a variety of optical systems that reside in the nonlinear regime. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems, these results could inform the noise levels displayed by such devices.

### **Qubit Module Design**

**Prof. Oskar Painter, *California Institute of Technology* (June 2023 - September 2023)**

Converged on qubit module parameters that optimize the transfer fidelity of a flying photon emitted by an optomechanical transducer. Performed detailed error analyses to mitigate the effeciency drop due to multiple loss channels. I further prototyped several physical layouts with distinct qubit geometries in Sonnet to determine which configurations were physically realizable.

### **Herrera Lab**

**Prof. Felipe Herrera, *Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH)* (June 2022 - August 2022)**

Classified birifringent materials based on their refractive indices using a feed-forward Neural Network trained on solely optical information. Determined input data in the form of Mueller matrices and Brewster's angles in reflection using polarimetry techniques. Engineered loss landscapes of a fixed window centered around Barium Borate (BBO) with varying resolution to measure the model's extrapolation ability.

Preprint in progress, to be submitted to [Optics Continuum](https://opg.optica.org/optcon/journal/optcon/about.cfm). Presentation slides [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YfTkdYzfpCecb7MT1aOk_rz3cuTaO33E).
