### **State Propogation Modeling**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing **QuTiP** software to characterize state propagations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPO) + atom cloud system. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems allow us to draw conclusions about the noise levels displayed by such devices.

### **Qubit Module Design**

**Prof. Oskar Painter, *California Institute of Technology* (June 2023 - September 2023)**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/wallraff_fig_1_edited.png" alt="" width="350" height="175">

Converged on qubit module parameters that optimize the transfer fidelity of a flying photon emitted by an **optomechanical transducer**. Performed detailed error analyses to mitigate the efficiency drop due to multiple loss channels. I further prototyped several physical layouts with distinct qubit geometries in **Sonnet** to determine which configurations were physically realizable.

### **Birifringent Material Classification**

**Prof. Felipe Herrera, *Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH)* (June 2022 - August 2022)**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/brewster.png" alt="" width="350" height="175">

Classified birifringent materials based on their refractive indices using a **feed-forward Neural Network (NN)** trained solely on optical information. Determined input data in the form of Mueller matrices and Brewster's angles in reflection using polarimetry techniques. Engineered **loss landscapes** of a fixed window centered around Barium Borate (BBO) with varying resolution to measure the model's extrapolation ability.

### **Vanadium Phase Diagram Computation**

**Prof. David Goldhaber-Gordon, *Stanford University* (April 2022 - June 2022)**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/hall.png" alt="" width="350" height="175">

Measured the magnetic field near a pure Vanadium disk isothermally with a **Hall sensor** across a range of different temperatures (slow axis) and external magnetic fields (fast axis). Personal contributions included constructing the solenoid (hand-wiring), electronics layout and assembly, and software/hardware interfacing using **Python**. This quarter-long research project was performed in PHYSICS 108, an accelerated, guided experimental research experience.

### **Cuprate Superconductor Curve Corrections**

**Prof. Zhi-Xun Shen, *Stanford University* (June 2021 - August 2021)**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/edc.png" alt="" width="350" height="175">

Computed corrections to energy/momentum distribution curves (EDC/MDCs) of Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) **angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)** data via matrix convolutions. Deployed **Igor Pro** software to procedurally extend the first Brillouin zone of high $$T_c$$ cuprate superconductors to cover a broader range of the crystal lattice.

### **Autonomous Environment Generation**

**Beyond Vision, *Lisbon, Portugal* (June 2020 - March 2021)**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/yolo_final.png" alt="" width="350" height="175">

Proposed a new testbed utilizing the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to procedurally generate and place 3D models to create realistic environments based on satellite images, thus providing users with a more robust example of real-world UAV deployment. Main contribution was creating a feature segmentation model using **YOLOv4** and **MASK R-CNN** (using buildings, trees, roads, etc. as objects) for placement in simulation.
