### **Wingman Control**

**A Single Hand Manual UAV Controller**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/wingman_control.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Integrated palm/finger positional tracking using the **Leap Motion SDK** to fully control a UAV in **Gazebo** simulation or live. Mapped trajectory inputs and smoothed sequences such as roll, pitch, yaw, throttle, 360 flip, takeoff, and landing using the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** in **Python** and **C++**.

This project was part of an internship at **Beyond Vision** in the summer of 2019. Code is publicly unavailable.

### **VR Gladiator UI**

**Multiplayer Platform User Interface Design**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/unreal.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Created a User Interface (UI) for a multiplayer Virtual Reality (VR) Platformer "VR Gladiator" using **Unreal** (scripting in **C++**). Designed pause menu layout and player interaction with VR controllers using the Unreal's VR Expansion Plugin. Gained familiarity with VR game development in **Unity** (scripting in **C#**) through a series of small onboarding projects.

This project was part of an internship at **ZPX - Interactive Software** (now **Funcom ZPX**) from summer 2018 to spring 2019. Code is publicly unavailable.

### **Cubot**

**A Rubik's Cube Solving Robot**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/cubot.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Programmed and constructed a Rubikâ€™s Cube Solving Robot built on top of a **Raspberry Pi** in bare-metal **C**. Wired a circuit powering 6 servomotors that precisely turn each face of the cube on command. Wrote a custom solver using **3-style**, the blindfolded method that I'm currently learning.

### **Multi BLD**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing **QuTiP** software to characterize state propogations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a variety of optical systems that reside in the **nonlinear regime**. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems, these results could inform the noise levels displayed by such devices.
