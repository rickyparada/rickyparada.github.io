### **Leap Motion**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing **QuTiP** software to characterize state propogations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a variety of optical systems that reside in the **nonlinear regime**. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems, these results could inform the noise levels displayed by such devices.
