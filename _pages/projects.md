### **Wingman Control**

**A Single Hand Manual UAV Controller**

<img align="right" src="./../assets/img/wingman_control.png" alt="" width="300" height="200">

Integrated palm/finger positional tracking using the **Leap Motion SDK** to fully control a UAV in **Gazebo** simulation or live. Mapped trajectory inputs and smoothed sequences such as roll, pitch, yaw, throttle, 360 flip, takeoff, and landing using the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** in **Python** and **C++**.

This project was part of an internship at **Beyond Vision** in the summer of 2019. Code is publicly unavailable.

### **Cubot: The Rubik's Cube Solving Robot**

**Prof. Hideo Mabuchi, *Stanford University* (January 2024 - Present)**

Writing **QuTiP** software to characterize state propogations from Quantum Input/Output Networks (QIONs) using SLH. We aim to quantify the advantage of a coherent controller in a variety of optical systems that reside in the **nonlinear regime**. Viewing optomechanical sensors as control systems, these results could inform the noise levels displayed by such devices.
