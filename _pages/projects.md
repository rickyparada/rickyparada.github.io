### **Cubot**

**A Rubik's Cube Solving Robot**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/cubot.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Programmed and constructed a Rubikâ€™s Cube Solving Robot built on top of a **Raspberry Pi** in bare-metal **C**. Wired a circuit powering 6 servomotors that precisely turn each face of the cube on command. Wrote a custom solver using **3-style**, the blindfolded method that I'm currently learning, which conveniently produces solve times that match my sighted 3x3 abilities (9-12 seconds).

### **Wingman Control**

**A Single Hand Manual UAV Controller**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/wingman_control.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Integrated palm/finger positional tracking using the **Leap Motion SDK** to fully control a UAV in **Gazebo** simulation or live. Mapped trajectory inputs and smoothed sequences such as roll, pitch, yaw, throttle, 360 flip, takeoff, and landing using the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** in **Python** and **C++**.

This project was part of an internship at **Beyond Vision** in the summer of 2019. Code is publicly unavailable.

### **VR Gladiator UI**

**Multiplayer Platform User Interface Design**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/unreal.png" alt="" width="300" height="175">

Created a User Interface (UI) for a multiplayer Virtual Reality (VR) Platformer "VR Gladiator" using **Unreal** (scripting in **C++**). Designed pause menu layout and player interaction with VR controllers using the Unreal's VR Expansion Plugin. Gained familiarity with VR game development in **Unity** (scripting in **C#**) through a series of small onboarding projects.

This project was part of an internship at **ZPX - Interactive Software** (now **Funcom ZPX**) from summer 2018 to spring 2019. Code is publicly unavailable.

### **Speedcubing**

**Competitive Rubik's Cube Solving**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/wca.png" alt="" width="250" height="175">

Regular participant and staffer of regional/national speedcubing competitions regulated by the **World Cube Association** (WCA). Competitive on a national level in blindfolded (BLD) events, ranking 57th in the US as of February 2024. Favorite event is 3x3 Multi-Blind, testing how many 3x3's you can solve consecutively blindfolded in under an hour- a true test of one's memory, mental fortitude, and composure. Some noteable (at home) personal bests: **3x3- 7.09; 3x3 BLD- 42.34; Multi-Blind- 16/16 in 59:06.45**.

My WCA profile [available here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018PARA15?event=333mbf){:target="_blank"}. Semi-recent Multi-Blind attempt [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uUi9wZOPU9IS58P6kI1puEFA8WDebOZJ/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

### **Long Distance Running**

**5k/Half Marathon/Marathon Running**

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="./../assets/img/marathon.png" alt="" width="175" height="175">

Avid long distance runner specializing in marathons, racing the hilly San Francisco Marathon in 2021 and 2023. Current personal best is **3:23:48**, which converts to 7:47 pace (per mile). This result placed me in the top 7% overall and top 13% for my gender/age group. I hope to one day run a sub-3 hour marathon and qualify for the Boston Marathon.
